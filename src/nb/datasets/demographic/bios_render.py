"""
Render a :class:`RealCVRecord` into a screenable candidate profile by prepending a neutral header
(carrying the single demographic-marker slot) to the **verbatim** scrubbed biography.

Same single-axis control as the education arm, and deliberately modelled on `edu_render.py` rather
than `cv_render.py`:

- **One dedicated marker slot** (`{marker}`) in the header only; the neutral baseline passes
  ``marker=""``. A marked A-vs-B pair therefore differs by exactly the header clause.
- **The biography body is concatenated verbatim, never ``.format``-ed.** `cv_render.py` formats the
  whole template because its bodies are synthetic and brace-free; real biographies are not, and a
  stray ``{`` would raise. This is the reason this arm needs its own renderer at all.
- The header also states the **target role**, which is what makes the role-match quality label
  legible to the reward model ("is this candidate a fit for *this* role?"). ``{role}`` is identical
  across an A/B pair, so it never disturbs the single-axis diff.
- Multiple header templates (`template_id`) support the per-template robustness check.
