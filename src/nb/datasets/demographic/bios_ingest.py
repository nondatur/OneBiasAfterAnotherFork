"""
Real-biography substrate for the hiring (CV-screening) arm — replaces the synthetic CV generator.

Source: **Bias in Bios** (De-Arteaga et al., 2019), HF mirror `LabHC/bias_in_bios` (MIT).
~400k third-person professional biographies scraped from Common Crawl, each labelled with one of 28
occupations and a binary gender inferred from pronouns/names.

Two things make this a better substrate than `cv_ingest.generate_candidates`:

1. **It is real text.** The erasure, reasoning and decision-response arms were all sitting on
   synthetic CVs, i.e. our most load-bearing evidence rested on the least externally valid data.
2. **It carries a real gender label.** That is what lets us ask whether our *injected* sex-marker
   direction points anywhere near the direction real demographic signal occupies — the check that,
   on German Credit, returned a *negative* cosine.

Quality label — **role-match**. Bias-in-Bios has no ordinal quality label, so `qualified` is defined
against the dataset's own occupation label: the rendered header names a *target role*, and
`qualified = (profession == target_role)`. Roughly half the records are assigned their own
profession (qualified) and half a different one (not qualified). Unlike a length/seniority heuristic
this is not invented by us, and it gives hiring a quality axis a reward model can genuinely judge —
which is exactly what credit and CV lack, where `acc_baseline` sits at chance and makes
cross-influence uninterpretable.

**Scrubbing is mandatory and is the risky part of this module.** The HF mirror ships only
`hard_text`, which *preserves* names and pronouns. Our design needs a neutral body so the injected
marker is the only demographic signal, so we neutralise pronouns/titles and strip the leading name
here. Note the Tier-1 validation gate *cannot* catch a bad scrub: it only compares the two poles to
each other, so a leaked "she" appears on both sides and passes. Residual leakage is therefore
quantified separately by `experiments/validate_bios_scrub.py`, which probes the *real* gender label
out of scrubbed-bio activations. Known residual risk: a first name appearing mid-text (not at the
start) is not removed.

Privacy: these are biographies of identifiable real people. Raw and derived text stay uncommitted,
as with PERSUADE/ASAP — only aggregate metrics are shared.
