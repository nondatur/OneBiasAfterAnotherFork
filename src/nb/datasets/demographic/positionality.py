"""
Positioned-argument (A2) injection for the education arm — *standpoint-credibility* bias.

Unlike the A1 header markers (identity as incidental metadata: "the student is a woman"), A2 makes the
identity **load-bearing for the argument's authority**: a first-person positionality sentence grounds the
essay's conclusion in the author's lived experience. We hold the real essay body **byte-identical** and swap
only the claimed identity, so a matched A/B pair asks: does the RM reward the *same argument* differently
depending on *whose* standpoint is claimed?

The injected sentence is one distinctive, full sentence with a single ``{identity}`` slot, inserted at a
configurable **position** (conclusion [v1] / opening / middle / random). Because the whole sentence is the
swapped unit (not just the short identity phrase), the shared single-slot Tier-1 gate applies unchanged:
stripping the sentence from each side yields the identical essay body. For the ``random``/``middle``
positions the insertion index is chosen **once** and reused for both poles, so the remainders still match.

Identity phrases are intentionally *not* length-matched (they legitimately differ); the generator relaxes the
Tier-1 char-delta bound for this arm. A ``neutral`` rendering (no positionality) is provided so a follow-up
can measure the clause's *main effect* separately from the identity *difference*.
